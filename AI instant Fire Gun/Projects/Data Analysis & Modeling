# Data Analysis & Modeling

Welcome to the **Data Analysis & Modeling** folder! This directory contains a collection of data analysis projects and predictive modeling work that utilize various datasets to answer critical business questions, analyze trends, and build predictive models.

## Overview

This folder features projects that highlight unique findings and contribute to the understanding of data-driven decision-making. The analyses utilize exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques.

## Projects Included

1. **Bank Churn Analysis**
   - **Description**: This project aimed to analyze customer churn, uncovering the factors influencing customer retention and attrition rates.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).

2. **Car Purchasing Prices**
   - **Description**: A comparative analysis of predicting car purchasing prices using Linear Regression (LR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The ANN model outperformed LR in capturing non-linear patterns in the dataset.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow.

3. **Heart Attack Risk Prediction**
   - **Description**: This project evaluated the risk of heart attacks using various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting). The Random Forest model showed the highest accuracy and a good balance between precision and recall.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn.

4. **Attrition Analysis**
   - **Description**: This analysis explored factors leading to employee attrition using a dataset created by IBM. The project utilized Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting models to predict employee turnover.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn.

5. **Blinkit Data Analysis**
   - **Description**: This project focused on analyzing sales trends, product performance, and customer satisfaction for Blinkit. Various visualizations provided insights into inventory management, customer demographics, and delivery efficiency.
   - **Technologies Used**: Power BI.

6. **Kaggle Notebooks**
   - **Description**: A collection of various Kaggle notebooks analyzing different datasets, providing insights and visualizations for specific problems.

## Key Findings

Throughout these projects, you will find insights such as:

- **Bank Churn Analysis**: Age, geography, tenure, balance, and credit card ownership significantly influenced customer churn rates.
- **Car Purchasing Prices**: ANN effectively captured non-linear patterns, outperforming traditional linear regression.
- **Heart Attack Risk Prediction**: Random Forest provided the best balance between accuracy and recall, making it the preferred model for identifying at-risk individuals.
- **Attrition Analysis**: Gradient Boosting emerged as the strongest performer, indicating valuable employee behavior insights.
- **Blinkit Data Analysis**: Identified peak sales periods, customer purchase patterns, and delivery efficiencies, aiding in strategic planning.
