# AutoML Projects

## Overview

This folder contains various projects and scripts related to Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) using different libraries. The projects demonstrate the use of various AutoML tools and techniques for efficient model training, evaluation, and selection.

## Contents

- **PyCaret**: Scripts and projects utilizing the PyCaret library for simplified model training and evaluation.
- **TPOT**: Projects that implement the TPOT library for automated machine learning pipeline optimization.
- **H2O.ai**: Code and examples using H2O.ai for scalable machine learning.
- **Auto-sklearn**: Implementations using Auto-sklearn for automated model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Other Libraries**: Any additional AutoML libraries or frameworks you may want to include.
